/* Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
- Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
- Array objects inherit from Array.prototype

The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.  

Array ------> Object ------> null 
String ------> Object ------> null
Function ------> Object ------> null

Everything in JavaScript is an Object  */
